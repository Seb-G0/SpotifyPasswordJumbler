# SpotifyPasswordJumbler

This Python script uses the Spotipy library to search for a song on Spotify based on user input and generates a password using a secure hashing algorithm (PBKDF2HMAC). 
The generated password is unique to the selected song and the user's input password. 
It provides a fun and unique way to create passwords based on songs and add another level of security.

Make sure to generate your own client_id and clientSecret before use.
